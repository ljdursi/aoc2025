I'm using this year's AoC to get more in the habit of writing code with AI coding tools.  This year it's mainly GitHub Copilot and Claude Code.  The idea is to solve the algorithmic problems myself, coding with GitHub Copilot, and use it and Claude Code to help with testing, refactoring, and documentation.
