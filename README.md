I'm using this year's AoC to get more in the habit of writing code with AI coding tools.  This year it's mainly GitHub Copilot and Claude Code.  The idea is to solve the algorithmic problems myself, coding with GitHub Copilot, and use it and Claude Code to help with testing, refactoring, and documentation.

The idea is not to have LLMs solve the problem, but to end up in the same amount of time with a relatively robust, tested, documented piece of code in the same amount of time (or less, if the tests help) that it would have taken me to do my usual attempt, get something hacky just barely to the point where it works.

(Whether documented, tested, and robust is really the point of AOC is kind of beside the point - I'm just having fun playing with the tools.)
